# Type Error in TypeScript
This example demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript where a variable of a specific type is assigned a value of a different type.

The `bug.ts` file contains a function that expects a string argument, but the code attempts to pass a number. This results in a compile-time error.

The `bugSolution.ts` file shows how to correct the type error by ensuring the variable's type matches the value assigned to it.
